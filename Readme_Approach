Feature Engineering:

We have  done EDA for the data points in plotply so that we get an overview of the data trend.
Based on the EDA, we have considered the following the variables..

1. Holidays
2. Monsoon
3. Weekend
4. Month Start
5. Month End

We tried transforamtion of data points along with AUTO ARIMA as the initial approach,but as we had to capture the sudden increase in peaks especially during holidays, we had to remove transformation and hence change the model.


We converted a univariate time series analysis to mulivariate time series analysis using XGBoost
